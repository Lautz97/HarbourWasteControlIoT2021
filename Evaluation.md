# HarbourWasteControl IoT 2021 - Evaluation
The aim of this document is to describe HarbourWasteControl's performance in term of the different paramenters listed below. These paramenters come from the recommendations provided inside/during the [IoT 2021 course 10589747](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2021), in particular from Lectures 9, 15, 19, 20 by [Prof. Ioannis Chatzigiannakis](https://github.com/ichatz) and Lecture 11 by [Prof. Andrea Vitaletti](https://github.com/andreavitaletti). Furthermore, the following evaluation concern both the one perfomed during the development and the one undertaken at the of the project.     

The evaluation of a paramenter comprises:
* Explanation of the evaluation methodology, 
* List of the key performance indicators 
* Indication of the tool used to analyse the specified indicators

## User eXperience and satisfaction 
As Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen state:
> User-experience encompasses all the aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services and its products.

### Evaluation methodology
Since the end-user is a key element for the project it is important to analyse the user satisfaction degree during the project development and when the the first release of HarbourWasteControl will be available. In order to this two different surveys will be conducted (Middle-term survey, First-release survey).

### Perfomance indicators

### Tool
To study such problem from their point of view, a direct survey tool has been used, that is a survey carried out to a pool of real shipowners via Google Forms platform (Official link to the Poll). The survey has been carried out in Italian as the people involved in the survey are Italian (Future developments of the project see it translated into English). The aim of the survey is to test the ship commandersâ€™ level of knowledge of wastewater draining procedures. Afterwards participants are asked to express their opinion about the introduction of a technological system for water quality measurement to prevent the illegal draining of waste substances in the docks.

To understand the effective validity of our initial project idea we talk to port managers and held a survey among boat owners.

## Network technology assessment
### Network traffic analysis

## Security and Privacy 
The feature offered by iot-lab.info is used to monitor the voltage, current and power consumption of the IoT system. 
The consumption of the node in iot-lab.info is measured through an INA226 hardware component.
