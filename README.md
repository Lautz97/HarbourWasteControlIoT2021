## Brief description
Docked boats, during their stay in the port, often illegally unload  wastewater in the sea (See [Concept](/Concept.md)), without being controlled by harbour authorities. In this connection HarbourWasteControl intends to monitor the quality of the port water, at each available dock, both when the ship is docked and when the dock is free. In particular, according to this inspection service, each [mooring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooring) boat, usually supported by qualified port staff, is also entirely surrounded by a Floating anti-pollution barrier [Floating anti-pollution barrier](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3919847). For each dock the project foresees the installation of a set of measuring sensors (See [Technology](/Technology.md)), positioned statically in it. In this way the perimeter of the boat is  circumscribed,  the potential discharge of substances in the sea is pointed out by the above-mentioned sensors and the corresponding polluted dock is signalled to the port authorities. Such protection of harbour waters would allow the safe bathing along coastal areas near ports, respecting both the swimmers’ health and the extraordinary beauty of EU’s coastal areas (one of the goals of [Blue Growth European Strategy](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/coastal_tourism))
