## Brief description
Docked boats, during their stay in the port, often illegally unload  wastewater in the sea (See [Concept](/Concept.md)), without being controlled by harbour authorities. In this connection HarbourWasteControl intends to monitor the quality of the port water. The project foresees the installation of a set of measuring sensors (See [Technology](/Technology.md)), positioned statically in it. The potential discharge of substances in the sea is pointed out by the above-mentioned set of sensor nodes spreaded all over the harbour, as well as it allows to estimate the values on all port water suface.
